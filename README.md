PRIOR HISTORY

The project is registered under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of UNFCCC with 10 years of crediting period (Reference No: 4877). Crediting period of the project under CDM starts on 01 Aug 2011 and ends on 31 July 2021. The project has already claimed carbon credits under CDM till 30 June 2012.  However, while the project is currently webhosted under CDM for the monitoring period “01 Jul 2012 - 31 Aug 2018”, the same monitoring period has not been pursued further for verification under CDM. Therefore, no double accounting is envisaged under the UCR mechanism.
